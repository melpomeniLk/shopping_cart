# React Online Store

## Project Overview
This project supports the main goal, allowing users to browse, add, edit, and add products to the cart. However, please note that local storage functionality for storing product data is not currently supported.

## Structure
The project is structured into four main components:

1. **Products List:** This component displays the available products for users to browse.

2. **Cart:** Users can view their selected products in the cart component along with the total price. If a product becomes unavailable, it is automatically removed from the cart.

3. **Add New Product Form:** Administrators can use this component to add new products to the store.

4. **Edit Products Form:** Administrators can edit the properties of existing products using this component.

Additionally, all styling for the project is managed in a single CSS file for consistency and ease of maintenance.


## Data Management
Product data is loaded from the `Products.js` file. Each product object includes an `id` property, which is passed as a prop to the `Product` component to uniquely identify each product.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
